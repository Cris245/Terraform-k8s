## Infrastructure Decisions

### Why Terraform for Infrastructure as Code?

**Decision**: Use Terraform with modular design  
**Rationale**:
- **State Management**: Centralized state tracking for team collaboration
- **Plan-Apply Workflow**: Preview changes before execution reduces production incidents
- **Modular Design**: Reusable modules promote DRY principles and consistency
- **GCP Provider Maturity**: Comprehensive resource coverage and active maintenance
- **Declarative Approach**: Infrastructure state is explicit and version-controlled

**Alternative Considered**: Google Cloud Deployment Manager  
**Why Rejected**: Limited ecosystem, vendor lock-in, less mature tooling

### Why Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)?

**Decision**: Use GKE for container orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- **Managed Control Plane**: Google manages API server, etcd, scheduler reducing operational overhead
- **Auto-upgrades**: Automatic security patches and version updates
- **Integration**: Native integration with GCP services (IAM, monitoring, logging)
- **Node Pools**: Different workload isolation (spot instances for cost optimization)
- **Regional Clusters**: Built-in high availability across zones

**Alternative Considered**: Self-managed Kubernetes on Compute Engine  
**Why Rejected**: Higher operational complexity, manual security patching, no SLA

### **Why Multi-Region Architecture?**

**Decision**: Primary (europe-west1) + Secondary (europe-west3)  
**Rationale**:
- **Geographic Requirement**: Company based in Spain, need European data residency
- **Latency Optimization**: Both regions provide <20ms latency to Spain
- **Disaster Recovery**: RPO <15 minutes, RTO <30 minutes for regional failures
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR compliance with EU data locality
- **Cost Efficiency**: europe-west1 has competitive pricing for sustained workloads

**Alternative Considered**: Single-region multi-zone  
**Why Rejected**: Single point of failure for regional disasters, no geographic distribution

## **Application & CI/CD Decisions**

### **Why Istio Service Mesh over GCP Load Balancer?**

**Decision**: Use Istio for traffic management  
**Rationale**:
- **Advanced Traffic Management**: Precise canary routing (header-based + percentage-based)
- **Security**: mTLS between services without application changes
- **Observability**: Rich metrics, distributed tracing out-of-the-box
- **Multi-Cluster**: Native support for cross-cluster service discovery
- **Policy Enforcement**: Consistent security and networking policies

**Alternative Considered**: GCP Global Load Balancer with NEGs  
**Why Rejected**: Complex health check configuration, limited traffic splitting capabilities

**Implementation Note**: We use privileged namespace for canary pods to accommodate Istio init containers while maintaining restricted security for stable workloads.

### **Why GitHub Actions for CI/CD?**

**Decision**: GitHub Actions with multi-stage pipeline  
**Rationale**:
- **Integration**: Native Git integration, no external CI/CD setup required
- **Security**: Built-in secret management, OIDC for GCP authentication
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent builds and tests reduce pipeline time
- **Ecosystem**: Rich marketplace for pre-built actions
- **Cost**: Generous free tier for public repositories

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Security Scan**: Trivy for vulnerability detection
2. **Build & Test**: Multi-stage Docker builds with testing
3. **Canary Deploy**: 20% traffic to validate new versions
4. **Production Deploy**: Full rollout after canary validation
5. **Automated Rollback**: Health-based failure detection

### **Why Canary Deployment Strategy?**

**Decision**: 80/20 traffic split with header-based routing  
**Rationale**:
- **Risk Mitigation**: Limit blast radius to 20% of traffic
- **Validation**: Real production traffic testing before full rollout
- **Header Override**: QA team can test canary with `canary: true` header
- **Gradual Rollout**: Can increase percentage based on success metrics
- **Fast Rollback**: Immediate traffic redirection on failure detection

**Metrics for Promotion**:
- Error rate < 1%
- Response time < 100ms (p95)
- Success rate > 99%

## **Security Decisions**

### **Why Pod Security Standards over Pod Security Policies?**

**Decision**: Use Pod Security Standards (PSS) with restricted profile  
**Rationale**:
- **Future-Proof**: PSP deprecated in Kubernetes 1.25+
- **Simplicity**: Built-in profiles vs custom policy definitions
- **Gradual Adoption**: Warn/audit modes for migration
- **Namespace Isolation**: Apply different levels per namespace

**Security Controls**:
- Non-root containers (runAsUser: 65534)
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped capabilities (ALL)
- No privilege escalation
- seccomp runtime/default profile

### **Why HashiCorp Vault for Secrets Management?**

**Decision**: Deploy Vault in development mode initially  
**Rationale**:
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted for secret management
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Database credentials rotation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete secret access logging
- **Integration**: Native Kubernetes authentication
- **Encryption**: Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit

**Production Considerations**: Would use HA mode with Consul backend and unseal automation.

### **Why Network Policies with Deny-All Default?**

**Decision**: Implement zero-trust networking  
**Rationale**:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Explicit allow vs implicit deny
- **Microsegmentation**: Pod-to-pod communication control
- **Compliance**: Meets SOC2/ISO27001 network isolation requirements
- **Incident Containment**: Limits lateral movement in case of compromise

## **Monitoring & Observability Decisions**

### **Why Prometheus + Grafana Stack?**

**Decision**: Deploy kube-prometheus-stack via Helm  
**Rationale**:
- **Cloud Native**: CNCF graduated project, Kubernetes-native
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific metrics (HTTP requests/sec)
- **Alerting**: AlertManager for incident response
- **Ecosystem**: Rich dashboard and alerting rule library
- **Cost**: Open source vs managed monitoring costs

**Custom Metrics Strategy**:
- Application exports `/metrics` endpoint
- ServiceMonitor auto-discovery
- HPA scales based on custom HTTP request rate

### **Why Horizontal Pod Autoscaler with Custom Metrics?**

**Decision**: Scale based on CPU, Memory, and HTTP request rate  
**Rationale**:
- **Responsive Scaling**: React to actual user demand vs resource utilization
- **Cost Optimization**: Scale down during low traffic periods
- **Performance**: Proactive scaling before resource exhaustion
- **SLO Maintenance**: Maintain response time SLOs under varying load

## **Operational Excellence Decisions**

### **Why Terraform Modules Structure?**

**Decision**: Separate modules for VPC, GKE, Monitoring, Security  
**Rationale**:
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used across environments (dev/staging/prod)
- **Testing**: Individual module testing and validation
- **Blast Radius**: Changes isolated to specific components
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different modules
- **Version Control**: Module versioning for stable deployments

### **Why GitOps with ArgoCD?**

**Decision**: Implement declarative deployment management  
**Rationale**:
- **Audit Trail**: All changes via Git commits
- **Rollback**: Git revert for immediate rollbacks
- **Multi-Cluster**: Consistent deployment across environments
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic drift detection and correction
- **Security**: No kubectl access needed for deployments

## **Trade-offs and Considerations**

### **Complexity vs Control**
- **Chosen**: Higher complexity with Istio for advanced traffic management
- **Trade-off**: Operational overhead vs granular control and observability

### **Cost vs Resilience**
- **Chosen**: Multi-region deployment for HA
- **Trade-off**: Higher infrastructure costs vs improved availability SLOs

### **Security vs Convenience**
- **Chosen**: Restricted Pod Security Standards with privileged namespace for Istio
- **Trade-off**: Complex namespace management vs security enforcement

### **Vendor Lock-in vs Integration**
- **Chosen**: GCP-native services (GKE, Cloud Monitoring) with open-source tools
- **Trade-off**: Some vendor dependency vs deep integration and managed services

---

## **Success Metrics**

### **SLI/SLO Definitions**
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- **Latency**: 95th percentile response time < 100ms
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% of requests result in 5xx errors
- **Deployment Frequency**: Daily deployments with <1% rollback rate

### **Business Impact**
- **Time to Market**: Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes
- **Cost Optimization**: 30% reduction in infrastructure costs via auto-scaling
- **Security Posture**: Zero-trust implementation meets compliance requirements
- **Developer Productivity**: Self-service deployments via GitOps
