## Infrastructure Architecture Decisions

### Why Multi-Region Instead of Single-Region Multi-Zone?

**Decision**: Deploy across two European regions (europe-west1 + europe-west3)  
**Reasoning**:
- **Business Requirement**: Company based in Spain, requiring European data residency for GDPR compliance
- **Risk Mitigation**: Single-region deployments have a single point of failure for regional disasters (power outages, network issues, provider incidents)
- **Latency Optimization**: Both regions provide <20ms latency to Spain, meeting our performance SLOs
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: The additional 30% infrastructure cost is justified by the 99.9% availability target

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Higher Complexity**: Multi-region requires cross-region networking, data synchronization, and failover logic
- **Increased Latency**: Cross-region communication adds ~5-10ms latency
- **Operational Overhead**: More complex monitoring, deployment, and troubleshooting

**Alternative Rejected**: Single-region with 3 zones  
**Why**: While simpler, it doesn't protect against regional disasters that could affect all zones simultaneously.

### Why Terraform Modules Instead of Monolithic Configuration?

**Decision**: Modular Terraform structure with separate modules for each component  
**Reasoning**:
- **Team Scalability**: Different teams can own different modules (Networking team owns VPC, Platform team owns GKE)
- **Risk Isolation**: Changes to monitoring don't affect networking, reducing blast radius
- **Reusability**: VPC module can be reused across dev/staging/prod environments
- **Testing Strategy**: Each module can be tested independently before integration

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: More files and dependencies to manage
- **State Management**: Need to coordinate state across multiple modules
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need to understand module interfaces

**Alternative Rejected**: Single large Terraform configuration  
**Why**: Would create a monolithic codebase that's hard to maintain and test.

### Why GKE Instead of Self-Managed Kubernetes?

**Decision**: Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  
**Reasoning**:
- **Operational Efficiency**: Google manages control plane, reducing our operational burden by ~40%
- **Security**: Automatic security patches and compliance updates
- **Cost Analysis**: Self-managed would require 2-3 dedicated engineers vs 0.5 FTE for GKE management
- **Integration Benefits**: Native integration with GCP services reduces configuration complexity

**Trade-offs**:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to Google Cloud Platform
- **Less Control**: Can't customize control plane components
- **Cost**: Higher per-node costs compared to raw VMs

**Alternative Rejected**: Self-managed Kubernetes on Compute Engine  
**Why**: The operational overhead and security responsibility outweighed the cost savings.

## Application Deployment Decisions

### Why Canary Deployments Instead of Blue-Green?

**Decision**: Implement canary deployments with 20% traffic split  
**Reasoning**:
- **Risk Management**: Limits potential impact to 20% of users during deployment
- **Real-World Validation**: Tests new version with actual production traffic patterns
- **Gradual Rollout**: Can increase percentage based on success metrics
- **Fast Rollback**: Can redirect traffic immediately on failure detection

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Requires traffic splitting logic and monitoring
- **Database Compatibility**: Need to ensure database schema changes are backward compatible
- **Session Management**: Users might switch between versions during deployment

**Alternative Rejected**: Blue-green deployments  
**Why**: Requires double the infrastructure capacity and longer switchover times.

### Why Istio Service Mesh Instead of Application-Level Load Balancing?

**Decision**: Use Istio for traffic management and service mesh capabilities  
**Reasoning**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Traffic management logic separated from application code
- **Advanced Routing**: Can implement complex routing rules (header-based, percentage-based) without code changes
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, tracing, and logging without application instrumentation
- **Security**: mTLS between services without application changes

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure layer to manage and troubleshoot
- **Performance Overhead**: ~5-10% latency increase due to sidecar proxies
- **Resource Usage**: Additional memory and CPU for sidecar containers

**Alternative Rejected**: Application-level load balancing with custom code  
**Why**: Would require significant application changes and ongoing maintenance.

### Why Container-Based Deployment Instead of VM-Based?

**Decision**: Use containers with Kubernetes orchestration  
**Reasoning**:
- **Consistency**: Same runtime environment across development and production
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better resource utilization compared to VMs
- **Deployment Speed**: Faster deployment and rollback times
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling is more efficient with containers

**Trade-offs**:
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs container and Kubernetes expertise
- **Debugging Complexity**: More complex troubleshooting in distributed environment
- **Security**: Container escape vulnerabilities vs VM isolation

**Alternative Rejected**: VM-based deployment with configuration management  
**Why**: Would be slower to deploy and harder to scale horizontally.

## Security Architecture Decisions

### Why Zero-Trust Network Policies Instead of Traditional Firewall Rules?

**Decision**: Implement network policies with deny-all default  
**Reasoning**:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only explicitly allowed communication is permitted
- **Microsegmentation**: Granular control over pod-to-pod communication
- **Incident Containment**: Limits lateral movement in case of compromise
- **Compliance**: Meets modern security standards (SOC2, ISO27001)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Configuration Complexity**: Need to define all allowed communication paths
- **Operational Overhead**: More complex troubleshooting and debugging
- **Development Impact**: Developers need to understand network policies

**Alternative Rejected**: Traditional firewall rules at cluster boundary  
**Why**: Provides less granular control and doesn't prevent internal lateral movement.

### Why Pod Security Standards Instead of Custom Security Policies?

**Decision**: Use Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) with restricted profile  
**Reasoning**:
- **Future-Proof**: Built-in Kubernetes feature, not deprecated
- **Simplicity**: Predefined profiles vs complex custom policy definitions
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can start with warn/audit modes and gradually enforce
- **Maintenance**: Less ongoing maintenance compared to custom policies

**Trade-offs**:
- **Flexibility**: Less flexible than custom policies
- **Migration Effort**: Existing workloads may need modifications
- **Namespace Management**: Need to balance security with functionality

**Alternative Rejected**: Custom Pod Security Policies  
**Why**: Deprecated in Kubernetes 1.25+ and requires ongoing maintenance.

### Why Secrets Management Instead of Environment Variables?

**Decision**: Use HashiCorp Vault for secrets management  
**Reasoning**:
- **Security**: Secrets encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Rotation**: Automatic secret rotation without application restarts
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of secret access
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control to secrets

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure to manage
- **Performance**: Additional API calls for secret retrieval
- **Dependency**: Application depends on Vault availability

**Alternative Rejected**: Environment variables in Kubernetes secrets  
**Why**: No encryption at rest, no rotation capabilities, limited audit trail.

- **Performance**: Maintains response time SLOs under varying load

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Requires application instrumentation and metrics collection
- **Latency**: Additional latency for metrics collection
- **Maintenance**: Need to maintain custom metrics and alerting rules

**Alternative Rejected**: CPU/memory-based scaling only  
**Why**: Would be reactive rather than proactive, potentially causing performance issues.

### Why Prometheus Instead of Cloud Monitoring?

**Decision**: Use Prometheus for metrics collection  
**Reasoning**:
- **Custom Metrics**: Better support for application-specific metrics
- **Cost**: No per-metric charges for high-cardinality data
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of exporters and dashboards
- **Portability**: Can be moved to other cloud providers if needed

**Trade-offs**:
- **Operational Overhead**: Need to manage Prometheus infrastructure
- **Integration**: Less native integration with GCP services
- **Scalability**: Need to handle Prometheus scaling challenges

**Alternative Rejected**: GCP Cloud Monitoring only  
**Why**: Higher costs for custom metrics and less flexibility for application-specific monitoring.
